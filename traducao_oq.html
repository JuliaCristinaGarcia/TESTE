                <p>Chances are you may have heard of Hercules, Aphrodite, and the Minotaur, or the Trojan War, among other mythological figures and situations, right? After all, mythology is a subject that crosses through content in various media, such as movies, series, cartoons, video games, etc.</p>
                <p>The study of mythology is important for reconstructing the way a certain people saw the world, as well as their religious beliefs. In this area, there is also a comparative analysis between different mythologies in order to find similarities between them.</p>
                <p>A very famous case is the story of a great flood, which appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh, belonging to <a href="https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/opiniao/2020/09/4873592-a-mitologia-judaico-crista.html" target="blank">Mesopotamian mythology,</a> and in the story of Noah's Ark, present in Jewish mythology. There are also stories about great floods in other mythologies, such as Hindu, Greek and Aztec.</p>
                <h1 id="t1">What is Mythology?</h1>
                <p>Mythology can be defined as the study of a collection of myths, usually placed under the umbrella of a common culture. <a href="../tipos de mitologia/grega/grega.html" target="blanxk">Greek mythology</a>, therefore, studies the myths of Greece; Egyptian mythology, the myths of Egypt, and so on. These stories seek to explain everything that exists and is important to a society.</p>
                <h1 id="t2"> What is Myth?</h1>
                <p>In the study of mythologies, a definition of the term myth is fundamental, for it is from its analysis that experts arrive at conclusions about the mythology of a given people. The word myth has its origin in the Greek term mythos, which means "narrative". Thus, mythology can be understood as the ways found by ancient peoples to explain their own reality, the origin of their traditions, of men, the events of nature, etc.</p>
                <p>Myth is an orally told story composed of fantastic beings: heroes, gods and mythological creatures. These are filled with teachings and form a type of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Myths are classified in two ways: cosmogony and origin myths. The former are related to events that explain the emergence of the universe, while origin myths explain the emergence of a place or a tradition.</p>
                <h1 id="t3">The meaning of myth today </h1>
                <p>Throughout history, the term myth has come to denote events or characters that seem to break with logic. When used for people, the word myth takes on the sense of identifying that person to a hero, something that is above ordinary people.</p>
                <p>However, when it is used to define events from the past, myths mean something possibly false, without confirmation, but that some people believe.</p>
                <h1 id="t4">How many mythologies are there?</h1>
                <p>It is not possible to pinpoint the exact number of myths or mythologies that exist. Various peoples have constructed different and complex mythological systems.</p>
                <p>However, all mythologies have a common characteristic: to serve as an explanation for the emergence of the world, for the elements of nature, and for the relationships between human beings.</p>
                <p>Many societies that had a mythical consciousness became extinct, others underwent a transformation process in which myths were replaced by other knowledge: philosophy and religion.</p>
                <p>However, on our site we will show and rigorously detail several types of mythology. See below the mythologies that we will present:</p>

                <h2><a href="grega.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;"></a>Greek Mythology</a></h2>
                <p>Greek Mythology is one of the most popular around the world, given that it has been covered several times in literary works, movies, and other types of media, as we explain.</p>
                <p>Surfaced in Ancient Greece, Greek mythology talks about the immortal gods, muses, and semi-divine creatures that explain natural phenomena, the origin of life, and the problems of our existence. All the gods of this mythology have characteristics similar to human ones.</p>
                <p>Thus, the creation of the fantastic narratives that engulf Greek mythology was the way the Greeks found to preserve their history.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that Greek civilization was based on a polytheistic religion, meaning that they worshipped several gods.</p>

                <h2><a href="romana.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;">Roman mythology</a></h2>
                <p>Roman mythology is the set of beliefs, stories, myths and legends that were told by the Romans in ancient times. They were passed down orally from generation to generation.</p>
                <p>Roman mythology is based on accounts of the origin of Rome and is strongly related to religious matters. This is because, before the rise of Christianity, the people of the locality were polytheistic, that is, they believed in several gods.</p> 
                <p>In addition to the gods, Roman mythology also encompasses other beings that were worshipped, such as nymphs, bacchantes, and fauns.</p>
                <h2><a href="egipsia.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;">Egyptian Mythology</a></h2>
                <p>Egyptian mythology has as a source for its studies the temples, pyramids, statues, tombs and ancient texts. Among the best-known gods are Ra-Atum, Osiris, Isis, Anubis, Thoth, Bastet, and others.</p> 
                <p>Remember that in ancient times Egyptian religion was based on polytheism, that is, the worship of several gods that usually occurred in temples dedicated to them.</p> 
                <p>The legends disseminated had as themes, the origin of the world, nature, men and gods. They explained phenomena still unknown to science, and were therefore of great importance in building the imagination of the Egyptians.</p>
                <h2><a href="nortica.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;">Nortic mythology</a> </h2>
                <p>Surfaced in Iceland, Norse mythology is based on tales and sagas that praise heroes. In addition, there is the belief that Earth is formed by a large flat disk.</p> 
                <p>In the middle of this disc is located Asgard, the place where the gods live. By crossing a long rainbow, called the Bifrost Bridge, one reaches the House of Giants. The part called Helheim is where the dead are believed to live.</p>
                <p>Like Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology, Norse mythology has great importance in shaping the culture of the ancestors of these peoples. To this day, it inspires movies, comics, videos, games, etc.</p> 
                <h2><a href="celta.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;">Celtic Mythology</a></h2>
                <p>The Celts, according to some scholars a collection of peoples, for others a race, spread throughout Europe, contributing to the constitution of several other nations. Their core location was probably Germany, but the so-called continentals spread to Hungary, Greece, and Asia Minor. They never formed a homogeneous bloc, but rather rival tribes, which did not even worship the same deities, except for a few common entities.</p>
                <p>The islanders were scattered throughout Britain and Ireland. It is generally to them that literature refers when mentioning the Celts. Belonging to the Iron Age, they formed small villages commanded by chiefs who also led fighting. There are no written documents about the continental Celts, but their gods became known through the Romans, who assimilated many of their gods to Celtic deities.</p>           
                <h2><a href="brasileira.html" style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;"> Brazilian mythology</a> </h2>
                <p>As in other mythologies, Brazil also has its gods. These are respected and feared mainly by the indigenous peoples. Brazilian mythology arose from the connection between the world and nature. The deities are represented by elements such as the moon, sun and thunder.</p>
                <p>At present, it is still possible to find cultures that follow these beliefs. Mainly in backlands, in the north and northeast of the country. Even more, there are indigenous tribes that preserve the customs and do the rain dance to attain the favors of their gods.</p>
